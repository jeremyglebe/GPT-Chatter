# What is supposed to be in this folder?

This folder should contain the following files
- `environment.ts`
- `environment.prod.ts`

Neither of these are uploaded with this repository for security reasons. You will need to create them yourself. Here is the format they should follow:

```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  OPENAI_API_KEY: '',
};
```

And here is the exact contents of `environment.ts` including comments that were generated by the Ionic CLI:

```typescript
// This file can be replaced during build by using the `fileReplacements` array.
// `ng build` replaces `environment.ts` with `environment.prod.ts`.
// The list of file replacements can be found in `angular.json`.

export const environment = {
  production: false,
  OPENAI_API_KEY: '',
};

/*
 * For easier debugging in development mode, you can import the following file
 * to ignore zone related error stack frames such as `zone.run`, `zoneDelegate.invokeTask`.
 *
 * This import should be commented out in production mode because it will have a negative impact
 * on performance if an error is thrown.
 */
// import 'zone.js/plugins/zone-error';  // Included with Angular CLI.
